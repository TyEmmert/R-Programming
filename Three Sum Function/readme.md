# Three Sum Function

### Two sum function
I found code to create a two sum function. I practiced writing out the logic, and was able to emulate the same concept.

### Three sum function
I used the logic from the two sum function to try and create a three sum function that I saw in an interview question for data science.
The code contains nested for loops to create a matrix of values that would sum up to make the desired number of your choice.
The code includes comments.
